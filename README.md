# AdAstraEducationOnlineLessons

This repository contains lesson plans originally developed by Dov Kruger at Ad Astra Education.
The materials here are seeded from the originals, and modified by teachers working together to create a great set of lessons for STEM instruction at home. This is our joint contribution to the community while we all fight the COVID virus together.
